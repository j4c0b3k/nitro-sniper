## Tips
- The less the latency to discord servers, the better; You could be competing with other snipers. <br>
    - High bandwidth hosting would benefit the sniper.
- There's a really high risk you might get terminated using this. <br>
    - Do not mention you have this anywhere. <br>
    - This is theoretically stealing money from discord.
